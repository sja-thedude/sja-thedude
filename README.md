- Iâ€™m interested in :robot_face: Robotics and :desktop_computer: Artificial Intelligence. I love Innovation , Robotics and will definately invote something like Elon Mask's Tesla, SpaceX or like David Hanson's Hanson Robotics!
- :+1: I have very active internal mental processes. I'm an INTJ; which means that i'm very logically minded, intuitive, analytical and with excellent problem solving skills.  I like to consider things thoughtfully before acting so that I can commit my energy confidently to a course of action. Iâ€™m a creative thinker who likes to entertain a wide range of possibilities. I like to focus on the facts whenever possible and let objective information guide my decisions and actions.I like  to stay organized and plan things out so that I can focus my energy on priorities. I donâ€™t easily lose my way when adversity strikes, and keeping a level head when problems arise helps me make good decisions and maintain an optimistic attitude.
- :slightly_smiling_face: Through Microverse, I'v learned to love collaboration; which we practiced through remote pair programming. I found working in teams and solving challenges in groups to be very productive, insightful and challenging.
