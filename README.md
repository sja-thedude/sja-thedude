- I‚Äôm interested in ü§ñ Robotics and :desktop_computer: Artificial Intelligence. I love Innovation, Robotics and will innovate something like Elon Musk's Tesla, SpaceX :rocket: or like David Hanson's Hanson Robotics ü¶æ!
- I love playing and working on video games as it's one of my field of interest.
- I like reading science related stuff as it gives me knowledge on various topics and satisfies my curiosity to know new things.
- :+1: I have very active internal mental processes. I'm an INTJ; which means that I'm very logically minded, intuitive, analytical and with excellent problem-solving skills.  I like to consider things thoughtfully before acting so that I can commit my energy confidently to a course of action. I‚Äôm a creative thinker who likes to entertain a wide range of possibilities. I like to focus on the facts whenever possible and let objective information guide my decisions and actions. I like  to stay organized and plan things out so that I can focus my energy on priorities.
- :slightly_smiling_face: Through Microverse, I've learned to love collaboration; which we practiced through remote pair programming. I found working in teams and solving challenges in groups to be very productive, insightful and challenging.
